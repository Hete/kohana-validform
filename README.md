What is ValidForm ?

ValidForm is a Kohana module designed to provide client-side errors with server-side validation errors. It is based on JQuery to associate errors with field and print corresponding errors.

The main advantage is not to have to create two sets of validation and increase the system security as every validation are done on the server, so bad behaviors are easier to detect.
